# Coding-Quiz

Description
This project was created to show my skills using newly learned Javascript material. The project objective was to create a responsive web page in which a a series of questions are asked using Javascript. The questions will be checked against a pre-set list of correct answers. The program will then render a score out of the possible points at the end of the questions array. The page should then store the scores in local storage which will then be used to display highscores. I learned a great deal of new information creating this project and had many setbacks, some of which included determining how to create a high scores board using the scores kept in local storage. I couldn't seem to figure out how to accomplish this even after extensive hours doing research on the topic. This project has really tested me in terms of my grasp of javascript material which has become increasingly difficult for me to process.

Usage
An opening start page will render and the user will need to click the "start" button to link to the "questions" page and start the quiz.
The "questions" page will load and the user will be shown the first question.
The user will have 15 seconds to answer the question, otherwise the next question will display.
Once the last question in the array is answered the user will be shown their score out of the total points possible.
The user can also click on the "highscores" link in the top left corner to display highscores.
